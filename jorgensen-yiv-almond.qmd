# Implementing a simple model of almond yield anomaly response due to climate

The Lobell et at. 2006 paper contains a table that is the source for our transfer function that we will use in our model:

```{r}
# Load libraries
library(here)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r include-graphics, echo=FALSE, out.width='50%'}
# Use knitr to include graphic of table with equation we are using
knitr::include_graphics(here("table2.png"))
```

NOTE: when we use the mean minimum temperature, the output stats should be:

-   max: 1919.98
-   min: -0.35
-   mean: 181.44

## Here is a diagram showing our *inputs*, *outputs*, and *parameters*:

```{r}
# Use knitr to embed the drawn diagram that we create

knitr::include_graphics("diagram.png")
```

```{r}
# Read in data for use in the analysis
daily_data <- read.table("clim.txt", header = TRUE, sep = " ", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Source the function
source("almond-function.R")
```

```{r}
# Call the function
result <- almond_yield(daily_data)

# Print the results
print(result)
```

**TEST ANSWER** the maximum almond yield anomaly should be approximately *1920 ton/acre* the lowest almond yield anomaly should be approximately *-0.027 ton/acre* the mean almond yield anomaly should be approximately *182 ton/acre*

Yay! Our function works!
